### Given a system with a quantum length of 10 ms in its highest queue, how often would you have to boost jobs back to the highest prioritylevel (with the -B flag) in order to guarantee that a single longrunning (and potentially-starving) job gets at least 5% of the CPU?

 - So let's assume we have small processes arrive every 10ms into the system and we have one long process waiting in the lower priority queue (This isn't immediately after the system started)
 - Each time the boost time elapses we put the long process in the highest priority queue. When it's added to the top most queue it runs for one time slice and then it's priority is decreased.
 - Hence for every B boost time we get 1 time slice (=10ms). Therefore this 10ms should be 5% of B.
   10 = 5% of B
   B = 10x100/5
   B = 200ms
 - Therefore we can say that taing the boost time to be equal to 200ms works for the above.

We can take an example where 100 small processes with burst time 10ms arrive every 10ms. Run the below command to see how after around 200ms the long job gets a CPU time of 10ms and similarly after 400ms and 600 and so on.
Command to see the above case
```bash
./mlfq.py -q 10 -B 200 -l 0,200,0:10,10,0:20,10,0:30,10,0:40,10,0:50,10,0:60,10,0:70,10,0:80,10,0:90,10,0:100,10,0:110,10,0:120,10,0:130,10,0:140,10,0:150,10,0:160,10,0:170,10,0:180,10,0:190,10,0:200,10,0:210,10,0:220,10,0:230,10,0:240,10,0:250,10,0:260,10,0:270,10,0:280,10,0:290,10,0:300,10,0:310,10,0:320,10,0:330,10,0:340,10,0:350,10,0:360,10,0:370,10,0:380,10,0:390,10,0:400,10,0:410,10,0:420,10,0:430,10,0:440,10,0:450,10,0:460,10,0:470,10,0:480,10,0:490,10,0:500,10,0:510,10,0:520,10,0:530,10,0:540,10,0:550,10,0:560,10,0:570,10,0:580,10,0:590,10,0:600,10,0:610,10,0:620,10,0:630,10,0:640,10,0:650,10,0:660,10,0:670,10,0:680,10,0:690,10,0:700,10,0:710,10,0:720,10,0:730,10,0:740,10,0:750,10,0:760,10,0:770,10,0:780,10,0:790,10,0:800,10,0:810,10,0:820,10,0:830,10,0:840,10,0:850,10,0:860,10,0:870,10,0:880,10,0:890,10,0:900,10,0:910,10,0:920,10,0:930,10,0:940,10,0:950,10,0:960,10,0:970,10,0:980,10,0:990,10,0 -c
